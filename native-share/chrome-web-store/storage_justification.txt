The storage permission is essential for passing data from a webpage to the extension's popup window. When a user initiates a share from the page, the data to be shared (URL and text) is temporarily placed in chrome.storage.local. The extension's popup is then opened, which immediately reads this data to generate the correct share sheet. The stored data is only used for this single, user-initiated action. This is a necessary technical step for communication between the content script and the popup.
