The storage permission is used exclusively to save user-configured settings for the extension. This allows the user's preferences to be remembered across browser sessions, ensuring a consistent experience without requiring them to re-apply their chosen settings. No personal or browsing data is stored, only the user's direct choices for how the extension should function.  This includes "Quick Share" to email and phone numbers for frequent contacts.
