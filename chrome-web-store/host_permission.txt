Host permission for <all_urls> is required to allow the user to share content from any website they visit. One core functionality of the extension is to inject a content script that facilitates sharing via navigator.share. This script is only injected when the user invokes the extension and is necessary to enable sharing on any given webpage.  This can be tested at https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/web-share/
