Host permission for <all_urls> is required to allow the user to share content from any website they visit. One core functionality of the extension is to inject a content script that facilitates native shaving (navigator.share). This script is injected so the user can invoke the extension and is necessary to enable native sharing on any given webpage.  This can be tested at https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/web-share/
