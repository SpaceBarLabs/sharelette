Sharelette makes it easy to share content in your browser.  Think of it as a customizable "share sheet" similar to the one on your phone.

It achieves this by opening a popup containing the Sharelette web application when the user clicks the toolbar action button. The extension's only role is to pass the active tab's URL and title to this web application.
