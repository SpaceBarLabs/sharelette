Testing the extension is straightforward:

1. Install the extension.
2. Navigate to any public website (e.g., https://www.wikipedia.org/).
3. Click the Sharelette icon in the browser's toolbar.

Expected Result:
- A popup window should appear.
- The popup should load and display the Sharelette web application, hosted at https://sharelette.cloudbreak.app.
- The web application inside the popup should be pre-filled with the URL and title of the page you were on (e.g., "https://www.wikipedia.org/").
- All sharing functionality within the popup works as expected.
