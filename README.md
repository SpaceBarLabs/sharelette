### Extension

Sharelette completely transforms your browser's sharing experience. It replaces the limited, native desktop share dialog with a beautiful, powerful, and customizable "share sheet," similar to  the one on your phone.

When you click the "Share" button in your toolbar, Sharelette handles the request and presents a clean, centralized hub for all your sharing needs. No more wrestling with awkward menus--just one click to send links exactly where you want them to go.

It also adds support for share sheets (`navigator.share`) on desktop browsers.

### Bookmarklet

Want an old school bookmarklet instead of an extension?  We've got you covered.

### Mobile App

The Sharelette mobile app (PWA) can handle shares from any application so you can share on the go.
